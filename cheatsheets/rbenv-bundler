# Suppose the project uses Ruby version 1.9.3-p448.
rbenv local 1.9.3-p448

# Install the version-specific Bundler gem.
gem install bundler

# Suppose you already have a Gemfile.
bundle install

# Don't forget to rehash!
rbenv rehash

# If "rake" is a Bundler-installed gem executable, report its location
# with "rbenv which". The result should look like
# "${PWD}/vendor/local/ruby/1.9.1/bin/rake"
rbenv which rake

# Run "rake" without having to type "bundle exec rake".
rake
